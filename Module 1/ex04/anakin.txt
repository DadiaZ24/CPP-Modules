EXT. MUSTAFAR – LAVA RIVER BANK – DAY

The duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker has raged across the molten landscape. They are both tired, singed, and scarred from the intensity of their battle.

Obi-Wan flips from a floating platform onto a high embankment. He raises his lightsaber, poised and ready.

OBI-WAN:
It’s over, Anakin! I have the high ground.

Anakin stands on a lower platform, rage contorting his face, the Dark Side burning in his eyes.

ANAKIN:
You underestimate my power!

OBI-WAN:
Don’t try it.

With a furious yell, Anakin leaps toward Obi-Wan, lightsaber raised. But Obi-Wan, calm and precise, makes a swift defensive strike mid-air.

Slash.

Anakin screams as his legs and left arm are severed. He crashes onto the black sand at the edge of the lava river, writhing in agony.

Obi-Wan stands at the edge, overcome with sorrow.

OBI-WAN:
You were the Chosen One!
It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them!
Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!

ANAKIN (weakened, enraged):
I hate you!

OBI-WAN (pained):
You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

Obi-Wan turns and walks away, leaving Anakin burning on the slope as lava ignites his clothing. Darth Vader is born in fire and fury.
